What is that, exactly? A lot of people confuse working titles with topics. Let\\'s clear that Topics are very general and could yield several different blog posts. Think \"raising healthy kids,\" or \"kitchen storage.\" A writer might look at either of those topics and choose to take them in very, very different directions.A working title, on the other hand, is very specific and guides the creation of a single blog post. For example, from the topic \"raising healthy kids,\" you could derive the following working title See how different and specific each of those is? That\\'s what makes them working titles, instead of overarching topics.</p><h4>Unprecedented Challenge</h4><ul><li>Preliminary thinking systems</li><li>Bandwidth efficient</li><li>Green space</li><li>Social impact</li><li>Thought partnership</li><li>Fully ethical life</li></ul>',\r\n      comments: 19100,\r\n      bookmarked: 139\r\n    },\r\n    comments: [\r\n      {\r\n        avatar: require('@src/assets/images/portrait/small/avatar-s-9.jpg').default,\r\n        userFullName: 'Chad Alexander',\r\n        commentedAt: 'May 24, 2020',\r\n        commentText:\r\n          'A variation on the question technique above, the multiple-choice question great way to engage your reader.'\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // edit\r\n  blogEdit: {\r\n    avatar: require('@src/assets/images/portrait/small/avatar-s-9.jpg').default,\r\n    userFullName: 'Chad Alexander',\r\n    createdTime: 'May 24, 2020',\r\n    blogTitle: 'The Best Features Coming to iOS and Web design',\r\n    blogCategories: [\r\n      { value: 'fashion', label: 'Fashion' },\r\n      { value: 'gaming', label: 'Gaming' }\r\n    ],\r\n    slug: 'the-best-features-coming-to-ios-and-web-design',\r\n    status: 'Published',\r\n    excerpt:\r\n      '<p>Cupcake ipsum dolor sit.
